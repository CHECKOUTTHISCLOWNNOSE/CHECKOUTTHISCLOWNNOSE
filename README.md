i like making friends but i suck at initiating conversations. please dont make me grow as a person and get over this fault .p le,ase talk to me first. id be happy
<p> i dont want to make an actual dni due to how. useless they are but uhhh i do ignore(hide chat) everyone i see under the "proship tree" ,,, yknow the one. with the proship andy & leyley fans. i just automatically assume youre a proshipper and/or associate with proshippers and i want nothing to do with that. only reason i dont fully hide them is because its nice seeing people make fun of said proshippers</p>
<p> i also enjoy fully hiding random skins of fandoms/things i dont like for at the very least a day,,,no country humans or alfreds playhouse for me, folks! </p>

<p> also dni everyone under 13 and over 18 please. unless were already friends, i really dont want to talk to adults or tiny children. and of course basic dni </p>

<p> oh no! i accidentally made a dni!!!</p>
